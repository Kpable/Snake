# Snake

#### Purpose

Try to remake a simple game. Complete a second game in a ten game challenge. 

#### Game State

Work In Progress 

#### Status

On Hold

#### Progress

Game can be played but its not pretty. Snake grows, you do crash into yourself, not yet walls. Well yes walls but i was also working on a wrap around walls. 

#### Remarks

I did something similar using LibGDX and i tried to port it over to Unity. I think its coming along well. This is game 2 of a 10 game challenge i found a while back. I will need to get back to this eventually.

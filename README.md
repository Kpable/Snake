# Snake
Collect food pellets, try not to run into yourself or the wall. Good old classic fun.

#### Purpose
As an introduction to the world of game development, I took on the challenge to try to remake a simple and familiar gameâ€¦ after Pong.
#### Game State
~~Work In Progress~~ Complete
#### Status
~~On Hold due to~~ Complete despite my insatiable curiosity of game development.
#### Progress
Game can be played but it's not pretty. Snake grows, you do crash into yourself or the walls. Score tracking and high score saving.

A few things that ~~would be nice to complete (although arguably not be needed)~~ I seem to have ended up doing anyways.
- ~~Start menu~~
- ~~Game start countdown~~ (didn't make the list)
- ~~Game over menu~~
#### Remarks
I did something similar using LibGDX and this is my port of it over to Unity. I think it's coming along well. ~~I will need to get back to this eventually for nothing else than to finish this challenge.~~ I suppose this game is finished. (As i try very hard to avoid all the possibities the feature creep whispers into my mind)
